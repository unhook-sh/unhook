4. Click **Install**

### From VSIX File

If you have a `.vsix` file:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Click the `...` menu and select "Install from VSIX..."
4. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file

## Getting Started

### 1. Authentication

After installation, you'll need to authenticate with Unhook:

1. **Open the Unhook sidebar** - Click the Unhook icon in the Activity Bar
2. **Sign in** - Click "Sign in to Unhook" in the status bar or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Unhook: Sign in to Unhook"
3. **Complete OAuth flow** - Your browser will open to complete authentication
4. **Return to VS Code** - The extension will automatically detect the successful authentication

<Note>
If you don't have an Unhook account, you can create one for free at [unhook.sh](https://unhook.sh)
</Note>

### 2. Configure Your Workspace

The extension will automatically look for Unhook configuration files in your workspace:

- `unhook.yaml` or `unhook.yml` in the workspace root
- Custom path via the `unhook.configFilePath` setting

Example `unhook.yml`:
```yaml
webhookUrl: https://unhook.sh/your-org/your-webhook-name
destination:
  - name: local
    url: http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks
    ping: true
delivery:
  - source: "*"
    destination: local
```

### 3. Start Receiving Webhooks

Once authenticated and configured:

1. **Create a webhook URL** at [unhook.sh/app](https://unhook.sh/app)
2. **Configure your webhook provider** (Stripe, GitHub, etc.) to use the Unhook URL
3. **View events in VS Code** - Events will appear in the Unhook sidebar as they're received

## Configuration

### Extension Settings

Configure the extension through VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`):

#### Output Settings

```json
{
  "unhook.output.autoShow": true,
  "unhook.output.maxLines": 1000
}
```

- **`unhook.output.autoShow`** (boolean, default: `true`)
  Automatically show the output panel when new events are received

- **`unhook.output.maxLines`** (number, default: `1000`)
  Maximum number of lines to keep in the output panel

#### Event Management Settings

```json
{
  "unhook.events.maxHistory": 100,
  "unhook.events.autoClear": false
}
```

- **`unhook.events.maxHistory`** (number, default: `100`)
  Maximum number of events to keep in history

- **`unhook.events.autoClear`** (boolean, default: `false`)
  Automatically clear old events when the maximum history is reached

#### Configuration File Settings

```json
{
  "unhook.configFilePath": "./custom/path/unhook.yaml"
}
```

- **`unhook.configFilePath`** (string, default: `""`)
  Path to the Unhook config file. If not set, the extension will look in the workspace root.

### Workspace Configuration

The extension integrates with your existing Unhook configuration:

```yaml
# unhook.yml
webhookUrl: https://unhook.sh/your-org/your-webhook-name

destination:
  - name: local-dev
    url: http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks
    ping: true
  - name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com/api/webhooks
    ping: false

source:
  - name: stripe
  - name: github

delivery:
  - source: stripe
    destination: local-dev
  - source: github
    destination: staging
```

## Advanced Usage

### Team Collaboration

When working with a team:

1. **Shared Configuration** - Use a shared `unhook.yaml` in your repository
2. **Individual API Keys** - Each team member uses their own API key
3. **Environment-Specific Destinations** - Configure different endpoints per developer

### Provider Integration

The extension works with all supported webhook providers:

- **Stripe** - Payment and subscription webhooks
- **GitHub** - Repository and organization events
- **Clerk** - Authentication and user management events
- **Discord** - Bot and server events
- **Custom Providers** - Any webhook-enabled service

### Debugging Workflows

Common debugging patterns:

1. **Event Inspection** - Use the webview to examine request/response data
2. **Selective Replay** - Replay specific events or requests for testing
3. **Local Testing** - Route webhooks to different local endpoints
4. **Response Analysis** - Check response codes and timing information

### Keyboard Shortcuts

While there are no default keyboard shortcuts, you can set custom ones:

1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+K Cmd+S`)
2. Search for "unhook"
3. Assign shortcuts to frequently used commands

Recommended shortcuts:
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+u",
  "command": "unhook.quickPick"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r",
  "command": "unhook.events.refresh"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: "Failed to authenticate with Unhook"
- **Solution**: Sign out and sign in again using the command palette
- **Check**: Ensure you have a valid Unhook account at [unhook.sh](https://unhook.sh)

#### No Events Appearing

**Issue**: Events not showing in the sidebar
- **Check**: Verify your `unhook.yaml` configuration is correct
- **Check**: Ensure the webhook URL is properly configured with your provider
- **Solution**: Use the refresh button in the Events panel

#### Configuration Not Found

**Issue**: "No config loaded" error
- **Check**: Ensure `unhook.yaml` exists in your workspace root
- **Alternative**: Set custom path via `unhook.configFilePath` setting
- **Verify**: Check YAML syntax is valid

#### Replay Failures

**Issue**: Event replay not working
- **Check**: Ensure delivery is not paused (use "Toggle Event Delivery")
- **Check**: Verify destination URLs are accessible
- **Debug**: Check the output panel for error messages

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the log level:

1. Open Output panel (`Ctrl+Shift+U` / `Cmd+Shift+U`)
2. Select "Unhook" from the dropdown
3. Look for detailed logging information
