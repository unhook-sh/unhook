- **Shared webhook URLs**: Use the same webhook URL across your team
- **Real-time updates**: See when team members are active
- **Event sharing**: Share specific events with team members for debugging

## Configuration

### Workspace Configuration

Create an `unhook.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
webhookId: "wh_your_webhook_id"
server:
  apiUrl: "https://app.unhook.sh"
destination:
  - name: "local"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks"
delivery:
  - destination: "local"
```

### VS Code Settings

Configure the extension through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "unhook.configFilePath": "./unhook.yaml",
  "unhook.autoRefresh": true,
  "unhook.refreshInterval": 5000,
  "unhook.showNotifications": true
}
```

### Environment Variables

Set configuration via environment variables:

```bash
# API configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://app.unhook.sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://unhook.sh

# Authentication
UNHOOK_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
