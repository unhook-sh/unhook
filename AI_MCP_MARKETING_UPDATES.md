- **AI Agent Workflow**: How AI agents use MCP tools to trigger webhooks
- **Real-time Testing Demo**: Interactive workflow showing AI → MCP → Webhook flow
- **Code Examples**: Practical MCP tool implementation examples
- **Use Cases Grid**: Three key scenarios:
  - AI Agent Testing (customer service bots, task automation)
  - MCP Tool Validation (CRM integrations, payment processing)
  - End-to-End AI Workflows (order processing, content generation)

### 2. Enhanced Hero Section
Updated the main hero description to include:
- **AI-driven automations** testing capabilities

### 3. Expanded FAQ Section
Added two new FAQ items:
- **"How can I test AI calls with MCP servers?"**
  - Explains Unhook's role in AI workflow testing
  - Describes webhook capture for AI-triggered events
  - Highlights debugging capabilities for agentic systems

- **"What is MCP and how does it relate to webhook testing?"**
  - Defines Model Context Protocol
  - Explains the connection between AI actions and webhooks
  - Positions Unhook as essential for AI-driven development

### 4. AI + MCP Integration Features
The new section showcases:

#### Visual Workflow Demonstration
- **Step 1**: AI Agent receives user request
- **Step 2**: MCP Server processes tool calls and triggers webhooks
- **Step 3**: Unhook captures and enables inspection/replay

#### Interactive Code Example
```javascript
// AI Agent triggers MCP tool
await mcp.callTool('webhook-trigger', {
  endpoint: 'https://unhook.sh/wh_abc123',
  action: 'user_created',
  data: { userId: '12345', email: 'user@example.com' }
});

// Unhook captures the webhook
POST /wh_abc123
{
  "event": "user_created",
  "data": { "userId": "12345", "email": "user@example.com" },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Real-time Testing Simulation
