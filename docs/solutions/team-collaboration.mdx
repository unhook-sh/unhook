# Team Collaboration

Unhook's team collaboration features enable development teams to share webhook URLs while maintaining individual development environments, streamlining webhook testing and debugging across the entire team.

## Overview

Team collaboration in Unhook provides:
- Shared webhook URLs across your entire team
- Individual developer environments with automatic routing
- Real-time team activity monitoring
- Centralized webhook configuration management
- Seamless onboarding for new team members

## How It Works

### Shared Webhook URLs

Instead of each developer having their own webhook URL, the entire team uses a single shared URL:

```
https://unhook.sh/wh_team_webhook_id
```

This URL is configured in your webhook provider (Stripe, GitHub, Clerk, etc.) and automatically routes webhooks to the active developer.

### Intelligent Routing

When a webhook is received, Unhook intelligently routes it to the appropriate developer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Webhook Reception">
    Provider sends webhook to the shared URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Active Session Detection">
    Unhook identifies which team member is currently active
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Routing">
    Webhook is delivered to the active developer's local environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Team Visibility">
    All team members can see the webhook event in their dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Team Setup

### Creating a Team Webhook

1. **Create a new webhook** in the Unhook dashboard
2. **Set webhook type** to "Team"
3. **Invite team members** to the webhook
4. **Share the webhook URL** with your team

### Team Member Onboarding

New team members can join easily:

```bash
# 1. Install Unhook CLI
npm install -g @unhook/cli

# 2. Initialize with team webhook
npx @unhook/cli init --webhook-id wh_team_webhook_id

# 3. Start listening
unhook listen --port 3000
```

### Configuration Sharing

Share webhook configuration across your team:

```yaml
# unhook.yaml (shared in repository)
webhookId: "wh_team_webhook_id"
destination:
  - name: "local"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks"
source:
  - name: "stripe"
  - name: "github"
delivery:
  - source: "stripe"
    destination: "local"
  - source: "github"
    destination: "local"
```

## Features

### Real-time Team Activity

Monitor team activity in real-time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Developers" icon="user-check">
    See which team members are currently online
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhook Events" icon="radio">
    View all webhook events across the team
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event Routing" icon="route">
    Track which developer received each webhook
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Statistics" icon="bar-chart">
    Monitor team-wide webhook performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Individual Environments

Each developer maintains their own local environment:

```bash
# Developer 1
unhook listen --client-id dev1 --port 3000

# Developer 2
unhook listen --client-id dev2 --port 3001

# Developer 3
unhook listen --client-id dev3 --port 3002
```

### Centralized Configuration

Manage webhook configuration centrally:

```yaml
# Team configuration (unhooked.yaml)
webhookId: "wh_team_webhook_id"
team:
  name: "Development Team"
  members:
    - id: "dev1"
      name: "Alice"
      port: 3000
    - id: "dev2"
      name: "Bob"
      port: 3001
    - id: "dev3"
      name: "Charlie"
      port: 3002
```

## Use Cases

### Development Team Workflow

1. **Shared Development**:
   - All developers use the same webhook URL
   - Webhooks route to the active developer
   - No need to update provider settings

2. **Testing Coordination**:
   - Coordinate webhook testing across the team
   - Avoid conflicts when multiple developers test simultaneously
   - Share webhook events for debugging

3. **Onboarding**:
   - New developers get immediate access to webhooks
   - No manual URL sharing or configuration
   - Consistent development environment

### Feature Development

```bash
# Feature branch development
git checkout feature/new-payment-flow

# Start webhook listener
unhook listen --client-id feature-payment --port 3000

# Test new payment webhooks
# Webhooks automatically route to your environment
```

### Production Testing

```bash
# Production webhook testing
unhook listen --client-id prod-test --port 3000

# Test production webhooks safely
# Isolated from other team members
```

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Team Setup

```yaml
# unhook.yaml
webhookId: "wh_team_webhook_id"
destination:
  - name: "local"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks"
delivery:
  - destination: "local"
```

### Advanced Team Configuration

```yaml
# unhook.yaml
webhookId: "wh_team_webhook_id"
clientId: "dev1"  # Unique identifier for this developer
destination:
  - name: "stripe-handler"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe"
  - name: "github-handler"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github"
source:
  - name: "stripe"
  - name: "github"
delivery:
  - source: "stripe"
    destination: "stripe-handler"
  - source: "github"
    destination: "github-handler"
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

```yaml
# unhook.dev.yaml
webhookId: "wh_team_dev"
destination:
  - name: "local"
    url: "http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks"

# unhook.staging.yaml
webhookId: "wh_team_staging"
destination:
  - name: "local"
    url: "http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks"
```

## Team Management

### Inviting Team Members

1. **From the dashboard**:
   - Go to your team webhook settings
   - Click "Invite Member"
   - Enter their email address
   - Send invitation

2. **Via CLI**:
   ```bash
   unhook team invite user@example.com
   ```

### Managing Permissions

Control team member access:

- **View**: Can see webhook events
- **Replay**: Can replay webhook events
- **Configure**: Can modify webhook settings
- **Admin**: Full administrative access

### Team Activity Monitoring

Track team activity:

```bash
# View team status
unhook team status

# See active members
unhook team members

# Check webhook routing
unhook team routing
```

## Best Practices

### Team Coordination

1. **Use meaningful client IDs**: `dev1`, `feature-payment`, `prod-test`
2. **Coordinate testing times**: Avoid conflicts when testing simultaneously
3. **Share webhook events**: Use the dashboard to share important events
4. **Document configurations**: Keep webhook configs in version control

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature branches**: Use different client IDs for feature development
2. **Environment isolation**: Separate dev, staging, and production webhooks
3. **Testing coordination**: Communicate when testing webhooks
4. **Event sharing**: Share relevant events for debugging

### Configuration Management

1. **Version control**: Keep webhook configs in your repository
2. **Environment variables**: Use env vars for sensitive information
3. **Documentation**: Document webhook setup for new team members
4. **Regular updates**: Keep configurations up to date

## Troubleshooting

### Common Team Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Not Routing">
    - Check if you're the active developer
    - Verify your client ID is unique
    - Ensure your local server is running
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Developers Active">
    - Coordinate testing times with your team
    - Use different client IDs for isolation
    - Check team activity in the dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Issues">
    - Verify you have the correct permissions
    - Check team membership status
    - Contact your team admin
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration Conflicts">
    - Use environment-specific configs
    - Avoid conflicting port numbers
    - Coordinate configuration changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Debug Team Routing

```bash
# Check team status
unhook team status

# View routing information
unhook team routing --verbose

# Check your client ID
unhook status
```

## Security Considerations

### Team Access Control

- **Role-based permissions**: Control access based on team roles
- **Audit logging**: Track who accessed what webhook data
- **Secure sharing**: Webhook data is encrypted and secure
- **Access revocation**: Remove team member access when needed

### Data Privacy

- **Organization isolation**: Teams can only access their own webhooks
- **Event privacy**: Webhook events are private to your team
- **Secure transmission**: All data is encrypted in transit
- **No data retention**: Webhook payloads are not permanently stored
