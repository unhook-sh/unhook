# JetBrains Extension Release Automation

This document outlines the automated release system for the JetBrains plugin (`apps/jetbrains-extension`) that enables seamless publishing to the JetBrains Marketplace with optional code signing.

## Implementation Overview

The automation consists of two main components:

### 1. GitHub Workflow

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/jetbrains-extension-release.yml`:

**Triggers:**
- Automatically after the "NPM Release" workflow completes
- Manual dispatch for testing/emergency releases

**Conditions:**
- Only runs when the commit message contains "chore: version packages" (indicating a version bump)
- Only runs when the JetBrains extension's `package.json` version was actually changed

**Process:**
1. **Version Check**: Validates that this is a version bump commit and that the JetBrains extension version specifically changed
2. **Release**: Builds, verifies, signs (optionally), publishes to JetBrains Marketplace, and creates GitHub release

### 2. Composite Action

The composite action is located at `tooling/github/jetbrains-extension/github-release/action.yml`:

**Steps:**
1. **Setup Environment**: Uses the shared setup action and configures Java 21
2. **Setup Gradle**: Configures Gradle with wrapper validation
3. **Build Plugin**: Compiles the Kotlin/Java plugin code
4. **Verify Plugin**: Runs JetBrains plugin verification for compatibility
5. **Sign Plugin**: (Optional) Signs the plugin with provided certificate
6. **Build Distribution**: Creates the final plugin ZIP distribution
7. **Publish to JetBrains Marketplace**: Publishes using Gradle IntelliJ Platform Plugin
8. **Extract Changelog**: Reads version-specific changes from `CHANGELOG.md`
9. **Create GitHub Release**: Creates release with tag `jetbrains-v{version}` and attaches ZIP file

## Setup Requirements

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN`: Token for JetBrains Marketplace
  - Generate at: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/me/tokens
  - Requires publishing permissions
  - Should be associated with your JetBrains account

### Optional GitHub Secrets (Recommended for Production)

- `JETBRAINS_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`: Certificate chain for plugin signing
  - Should be in PEM format
  - Remove line breaks and store as single-line string
  - Enhances trust and security for plugin distribution

- `JETBRAINS_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for plugin signing
  - Should be in PEM format
  - Remove line breaks and store as single-line string
  - Must match the certificate chain

- `JETBRAINS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for private key (if encrypted)
  - Only required if your private key is password-protected

### JetBrains Marketplace Setup

Before publishing to JetBrains Marketplace:

1. **Create JetBrains account** at jetbrains.com
2. **Apply for publisher status** at plugins.jetbrains.com
3. **Create API token** in your publisher profile
4. **Plugin verification** is handled automatically by the workflow

<Note>
The automation will handle plugin verification and compatibility checks automatically during the build process.
</Note>

### JetBrains Plugin Configuration

The automation expects:
- Plugin built with Gradle and IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin (already configured)
- Plugin ID set to "sh.unhook.jetbrains" in `plugin.xml` (already set)
- Changelog maintained in `apps/jetbrains-extension/CHANGELOG.md` with version sections like:

```markdown
## [0.2.4] - 2024-01-15
- Feature description
- Bug fix description

## [0.2.3] - 2024-01-10
- Previous version changes
```

## Workflow Integration

### Automatic Process

1. **NPM Release**: Maintainer triggers NPM Release workflow (manually or via GitHub Actions)
2. **Version Bump**: Release script bumps versions and generates AI-powered changelog
3. **JetBrains Release**: If JetBrains extension version changed, the JetBrains Extension Release workflow automatically triggers
4. **Build & Verification**: Plugin is built and verified for compatibility
5. **Optional Signing**: If certificates are configured, plugin is signed for enhanced trust
6. **Marketplace Publication**: Plugin is published to JetBrains Marketplace
7. **GitHub Release**: Release created with ZIP file attachment

### Manual Fallback

If automation fails, manual release steps:

```bash
# Navigate to extension directory
cd apps/jetbrains-extension

# Build plugin
./gradlew build

# Verify plugin
./gradlew verifyPlugin

# Build distribution
./gradlew buildPlugin

# Publish to JetBrains Marketplace (requires JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN)
./gradlew publishPlugin
```

## Platform Coverage

Publishing to JetBrains Marketplace ensures broad compatibility across all JetBrains IDEs:

- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Community & Ultimate)
- **WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm** (Professional & Community)
- **RubyMine, CLion, GoLand**
- **DataGrip, Rider**
- **Android Studio** (Google's distribution)

## Plugin Verification

The workflow includes comprehensive verification:

- **Compatibility Check**: Ensures plugin works with target IDE versions (2024.2+)
- **API Usage Validation**: Detects deprecated or internal API usage
- **Plugin Structure**: Validates plugin.xml and overall plugin structure
- **Dependency Analysis**: Checks for missing or conflicting dependencies
- **Build Integrity**: Verifies successful compilation and packaging

## Code Signing (Optional)

The workflow supports optional plugin signing for enhanced security:

### Benefits of Signing
- **Enhanced Trust**: Signed plugins are marked as verified
- **Security**: Prevents tampering and ensures authenticity
- **Professional Distribution**: Recommended for commercial plugins

### Certificate Requirements
- **Code Signing Certificate**: From a trusted Certificate Authority
- **PEM Format**: Certificate chain and private key in PEM format
- **Key Management**: Secure storage in GitHub Secrets

### Signing Process
1. **Certificate Validation**: Verifies certificate chain integrity
2. **Plugin Signing**: Signs the compiled plugin with private key
3. **Verification**: Confirms signature validity
4. **Distribution**: Signed plugin ready for marketplace

## Monitoring

The workflow provides clear logging for each step:
- Build status and compilation output
- Plugin verification results with detailed reports
- Signing status (if configured)
- JetBrains Marketplace publishing result
- GitHub release creation

Failed steps will be clearly indicated in the GitHub Actions logs with actionable error messages.

## Security Considerations

- `JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN` is securely stored as GitHub secret
- Certificate and private key are encrypted in GitHub Secrets
- Signing certificates have minimal required permissions (code signing only)
- Plugin files are built from source during workflow execution
- All steps logged for audit trail
- No sensitive data exposed in logs

## File Structure

```
.github/workflows/
└── jetbrains-extension-release.yml

tooling/github/jetbrains-extension/
└── github-release/
    └── action.yml

apps/jetbrains-extension/
├── build.gradle.kts
├── gradle.properties
├── src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

<Note>
The workflow only triggers when the JetBrains extension version specifically changes. GitHub releases use the tag format `jetbrains-v{version}` to distinguish from other extension releases.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Version Management
- ZIP files are automatically attached to GitHub releases for manual distribution
- Version management is handled by the NPM Release workflow with AI-powered changelog generation
- Semantic versioning is enforced through the release script

### Quality Assurance
- Plugin verification runs before publishing to catch compatibility issues
- Build artifacts include verification reports for debugging
- Automated testing ensures plugin stability across IDE versions

### Security
- Code signing enhances plugin trustworthiness
- Secure token management through GitHub Secrets
- Certificate validation prevents distribution of compromised plugins

### Development Workflow
- The automation follows the same patterns as other release workflows for consistency
- Gradle-based build system provides reliable, reproducible builds
- Local development workflow mirrors CI/CD process

## Build Artifacts

Each successful build produces:

### Distribution Files
- **Plugin ZIP**: Ready for marketplace or manual installation
- **Build Reports**: Compilation and verification results
- **Verification Report**: Compatibility analysis

### GitHub Release Assets
- **unhook-jetbrains-{version}.zip**: Main plugin distribution
- **Build artifacts**: Uploaded for 30 days for debugging

### Marketplace Distribution
- **Automatic Publication**: Direct upload to JetBrains Marketplace
- **Version Metadata**: Changelog and compatibility information
- **Plugin Verification**: Marketplace runs additional checks

This automation provides a production-ready, secure release pipeline that ensures high-quality plugin distribution while maintaining security and reliability standards.
