# Unhook Self-Hosted Configuration Example
# 
# This example shows how to configure Unhook CLI to connect to a self-hosted instance
# instead of the cloud service at unhook.sh

# Your webhook ID from the self-hosted dashboard
webhookId: 'wh_example123'

# Server configuration for self-hosted deployment
server:
  # The API URL of your self-hosted Unhook instance
  apiUrl: 'https://api.your-domain.com'
  
  # The dashboard URL (optional, defaults to apiUrl)
  dashboardUrl: 'https://dashboard.your-domain.com'

# Destination configuration - where webhooks should be forwarded
destination:
  - name: 'local-dev'
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks'
    
  - name: 'local-test'
    url: 'http://localhost:4000/api/test-webhooks'

# Delivery rules - which webhooks go to which destination
delivery:
  # Send all webhooks to local-dev by default
  - destination: 'local-dev'
    
  # Send webhooks from 'test' source to local-test
  - source: 'test'
    destination: 'local-test'

# Optional: Enable debug mode
debug: false

# Optional: Enable telemetry (helps improve Unhook)
telemetry: true
