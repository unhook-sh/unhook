- `apps/jetbrains-extension/gradlew`
- `apps/jetbrains-extension/gradlew.bat`
- `apps/jetbrains-extension/gradle/wrapper/README.md`

**Purpose**: Gradle wrapper for consistent builds across environments

### 4. Documentation
**Files**:
- `apps/jetbrains-extension/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `JETBRAINS_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Workflow Features

### Triggers
- **Automatic**: Triggers when changeset workflow bumps JetBrains extension version
- **Manual**: Can be manually triggered from GitHub Actions interface
- **Conditional**: Only runs when the JetBrains extension version actually changes

### Environment Setup
- **Node.js & Bun**: For workspace compatibility
- **Java 21**: Required for modern JetBrains platform development
- **Gradle**: Latest wrapper with caching for optimal performance

### Build Process
1. **Environment Setup**: Multi-runtime environment preparation
2. **Gradle Validation**: Ensures wrapper integrity
3. **Plugin Build**: Complete Kotlin/Java compilation
4. **Plugin Verification**: Compatibility and API usage validation
5. **Plugin Signing**: Optional certificate-based signing for trusted distribution
6. **Distribution Creation**: Packaging for marketplace deployment
7. **Marketplace Publishing**: Automated upload to JetBrains Marketplace
8. **GitHub Release**: Automatic release with changelog and artifacts

### Security & Signing
- **Optional Plugin Signing**: Support for code signing certificates
- **Secure Token Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets for marketplace authentication
- **Certificate Chain Validation**: Proper PKI certificate handling
- **Environment Variable Protection**: Sensitive data managed through GitHub Secrets

## Required GitHub Secrets

### Essential
- `JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN`: Authentication for JetBrains Marketplace publishing

### Optional (Recommended for Production)
- `JETBRAINS_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`: Certificate chain for plugin signing
- `JETBRAINS_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for plugin signing  
- `JETBRAINS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for encrypted private keys

## Integration with Repository

### Turbo Configuration
Updated `turbo.json` with JetBrains-specific tasks:
- `unhook-jetbrains#build`: Plugin compilation and packaging
- `unhook-jetbrains#dev`: Development server (IDE with plugin)
- `unhook-jetbrains#verify`: Plugin verification and compatibility checks
- `unhook-jetbrains#package`: Distribution creation

### Package.json Integration
The JetBrains extension includes:
- Gradle-based build scripts accessible via `bun run` commands
- Workspace-compatible package configuration
- Version synchronization with changeset workflow

## Comparison with VSCode Workflow

### Similarities
- ✅ Changeset-triggered releases
- ✅ Version change detection
- ✅ Conditional execution
- ✅ GitHub release creation
- ✅ Artifact uploads
- ✅ Changelog extraction
- ✅ Manual trigger capability

### JetBrains-Specific Adaptations
- **Build System**: Gradle instead of npm/bun
- **Runtime**: Java 21 instead of Node.js only
- **Verification**: Plugin compatibility checks
- **Signing**: Certificate-based code signing
- **Marketplace**: JetBrains Marketplace instead of VS Code Marketplace/Open VSX
- **Distribution**: ZIP format instead of VSIX

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- **Plugin Verification**: Ensures compatibility with target IDE versions
- **API Usage Validation**: Detects deprecated or internal API usage
- **Plugin Structure**: Validates plugin.xml and overall plugin structure
- **Dependency Analysis**: Checks for missing or conflicting dependencies
- **Build Integrity**: Verifies successful compilation and packaging

### Artifact Management
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatic creation with proper versioning
- **Build Artifacts**: Uploaded for debugging and manual distribution
- **Distribution Files**: Properly packaged ZIP files for marketplace
- **Build Reports**: Verification and test reports for troubleshooting

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
cd apps/jetbrains-extension

# Development
bun run dev          # Launch IDE with plugin
bun run build        # Build plugin
bun run verify       # Run verification
bun run package      # Create distribution
```

### Release Process
1. **Create Changeset**: Use `bunx changeset` to bump version
2. **Commit Changes**: Standard git workflow
3. **Merge Changeset PR**: Triggers automatic release
4. **Monitor Workflow**: Check GitHub Actions for progress
5. **Verify Release**: Confirm marketplace publishing and GitHub release

## Benefits

### Automation
- **Zero-Touch Releases**: Fully automated from version bump to marketplace
- **Consistent Builds**: Reproducible builds across environments
- **Error Prevention**: Automated verification prevents common issues
- **Time Savings**: Eliminates manual publishing steps

### Quality
- **Verified Compatibility**: Ensures plugin works with target IDEs
- **Signed Distribution**: Optional signing for enhanced trust
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-stage verification process
- **Documentation**: Automatic changelog inclusion in releases

### Integration
- **Repository Standards**: Follows established patterns and conventions
- **Changeset Compatibility**: Works with existing version management
- **Parallel Releases**: Can release alongside VSCode extension
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reuses existing CI/CD investments
