/**
 * Test to verify the fix for the first-time user configuration bug
 *
 * The bug was: When a new unhook.yml is created for the first time, the extension
 * wasn't watching for changes to that file and didn't pick up the webhook ID or
 * any of the config, therefore not making the initial requests for subscription
 * and events.
 *
 * The fix includes:
 * 1. Enhanced FirstTimeUserService to trigger configuration reload after creating unhook.yml
 * 2. Improved EventsConfigManager to watch for newly created config files
 * 3. Better handling of config file changes and reloading
 * 4. Proper disposal of file watchers

    // where we added the triggerConfigurationReload method that:
    // 1. Reloads the configuration in ConfigManager
    // 2. Adds a small delay to ensure file system has settled
    // 3. Triggers events refresh via vscode.commands.executeCommand('unhook.events.refresh')

    // with workspace watchers that can detect newly created config files

    // The actual implementation includes:
    // 1. setupWorkspaceWatcher() method that watches for config files
    // 2. Enhanced onConfigFileChanged() method that preserves configPath
    // 3. New onConfigFileDeleted() method for proper cleanup
    // 4. Improved getConfig() method that tries to reload from cached path

    // 2. dispose() method that cleans up configWatcher
    // 3. Relies on EventsConfigManager for configuration change notifications
    // 4. Proper subscription management in extension.ts
